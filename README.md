# Beepbox Offline!
It's beepbox, but offline and native builds

Built from ElectronJS.

# Features

## Online Downloader
If Beepbox gets an update, this tool will auto-update

## Native Builds
Linux Users don't usually get attention, except here! (Don't worry, we still got Windows and MacOS builds)

## Easy to use!

# Install/Use Guide
This part is meant to be a unique guide for this software. Simply run the install script or unpack the binaries. There's an offline version, to copy to another offline computer.

Launch the `beepbox` executable from the right directory
